It can be used to determine defined filename extensions for MIME types), or to use filename extensions to look up the likely MIME type definitions. MIME content types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. The mime-types library provides the ability for detailed information about MIME entities (provided as an enumerable collection of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but by definition incomplete; don't hesitate to to add additional type definitions (see Contributing.rdoc). The primary sources for MIME type definitions found in mime-types is the IANA collection of registrations (see below for the link), RFCs, and W3C recommendations. This is release 2.4.3, restoring full compatibility with Ruby 1.9.2 (which will be dropped in mime-types 3.0). It also includes the performance improvements from mime-types 2.4.2 (since yanked because of the broken Ruby 1.9.2 support) and the 2.4.1 fix of a bug in observed use of the mime-types library where extensions were not previously sorted, such that MIME::Types.of('image.jpg').first.extensions.first returned a value of +jpeg+ in mime-types 1, but +jpe+ in mime-types 2. This was introduced because extensions were sorted during assignment (MIME::Type#extensions=). This behaviour has been reverted to protect clients that work as noted above. The preferred way to express this is the new method: MIME::Type.of('image.jpg').first.preferred_extension Łukasz Śliwa created the {friendly_mime}[https://github.com/lukaszsliwa/friendly_mime] gem, which offers friendly descriptive names for MIME types. This functionality and English-language data has been added to mime-types as MIME::Type#friendly. To make it easy for internationalization, MIME::Type#i18n_key has been added, which will return a key suitable for use with the {I18n}[https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n] library. As a reminder, mime-types 2.x is no longer compatible with Ruby 1.8 and mime-types 1.x is only being maintained for security issues. No new MIME types or features will be added. mime-types (previously called MIME::Types for Ruby) was originally based on MIME::Types for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. It is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It tracks the {IANA Media Types registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml] with some types added by the users of mime-types."  mime-types
